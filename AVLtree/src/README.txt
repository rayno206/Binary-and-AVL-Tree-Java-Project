# Instruction for AVL Tree and Binary Tree

Animation Speed: the speed of the animation is unchangeable during the animation, only changeable before the animation.

Animation Control:
	-the << is to go back to the start of the animation, the >> is to go to the end.
	-the < is the rewind, and > is the fastforward for the animation.
